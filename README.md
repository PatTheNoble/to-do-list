<h1> About this project: </h1>
<ul>
  <li> This is a basic to-do list I made as a React learning exercise. You can try it here! https://to-do-list-kappa-five.vercel.app/ </li>
  <li> There is no backend in this project, so your to-dos will not be saved! (You've been warned ðŸ’€)</li>
  <li> I loosely followed this wonderful tutorial: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_todo_list_beginning</li>
</ul>
