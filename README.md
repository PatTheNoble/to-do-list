<h1> Learning outcomes: </h1>
<p> 
  The to do list is often seen as a most basic and trivial project, but in reality there are many subtle complexities that go into making these apps.
  Some of these complexities include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li> Filtering the to do list and displaying the updated result using hooks, all in an efficient and succinct way. </li>
    <li> Receiving user input and creating a new to do item with the properties. </li>
    <li> Editing a to do item from the to do list and displaying the updated result. </li>
    <li> Highlighting <b>only</b> the currently active filter. </li>
</ul>
