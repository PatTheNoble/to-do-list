<h1> About this project: </h1>
<ul>
  <li> 
    This is my first project built with React and is one that I have done as a training exercise.
    <a href="https://to-do-list-kappa-five.vercel.app/"> You can try it here! </a>
  </li>
  <li> This is purely a front end project. Your to dos will not be saved!</li>
</ul>

<h1> Learning outcomes: </h1>
<p> 
  The to do list is often seen as a most basic and trivial project, but in reality there are many subtle complexities that go into making these apps.
  Some of these complexities include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li> Filtering the to do list and displaying the updated result using hooks, all in an efficient and succinct way. </li>
    <li> Receiving user input and creating a new to do item with the properties. </li>
    <li> Editing a to do item from the to do list and displaying the updated result. </li>
    <li> Highlighting <b>only</b> the currently active filter. </li>
</ul>
<p> 
  Overall, creating a to do list in React is a great learning exercise, you might learn <b>a lot</b> more than you expect.
